The deadline came and his wounds weren't healing properly so on the 12th of August he had another surgical debridement. The procedure went smoothly and he was back at home by 4PM the same day. The doctor found several small pieces of [surgical bone wax](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3805601/#:~:text=Bone%20wax%20is%20a%20nonabsorbable%20product%20used%20for,within%20body%20tissues%2C%20bone%20wax%20has%20possible%20side-effects.) which is used to help stem the bleeding of bones when they are cut. This bone wax would have been applied when his skull was separated in December. The surgeon also found one stitch that hadn't dissolved. Both the wax and the stitch were likely contributing to the inflamation that prevented the healing of his scalp.
