On December 21st, 2021, Liam had Posterior Vault Distraction surgery. The procedure involved separating the back half of Liam’s skull from the front half and attaching a mechanism (distractors) that separate the two halves over time. We spent the night in the PICU and another four days in the hospital after this surgery. Once we left the hospital, it was my husband’s and my responsibility to turn the distractors morning and night to push Liam’s skull back. We did this for forty days. During these forty days, Liam developed four severe infections. Our pediatric plastic surgeon finally removed the dangly parts of distractors, but the rest of the mechanism remained attached to his skull until April 19, 2022.
