The wounds on the right side of Liam's head look much better now, but some inflammation has appeared in the last few days. We're hoping the inflammation will subside and the wound won't reopen.

Liam went to a speech therapist this past week and was diagnosed with [Mixed Receptive-Expressive Language Delay](https://www.betterspeech.com/post/what-is-mixed-receptive-expressive-language-disorder). He'll be starting speech therapy right away. They recommended we start working on sign language in the interim.
