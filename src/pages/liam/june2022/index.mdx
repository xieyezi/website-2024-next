Liam's incisions on the right side of his head refuse to heal. The surgeon says that the tissue is too inflamed to create new skin cells and wants us to take him to the hospital either weekly or every two weeks to have a short surgery to debride or remove the hardened buildup over the incision wounds then cauterize the tissue underneath. We have a second opinion scheduled with Johns Hopkins All Children's hospital, and pending any further advice we're going to proceed with a plan to try to get his poor little head to heal. Topical medications like hydrocortisone which would reduce the inflamation are preventing any healing, so he's stuck in a terrible cycle where the wounds won't heal on their own.
